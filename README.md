# subsonic_clients
This is the repository for the website hosted on github pages [here](https://artiskongit.github.io/subsonic_clients/clients.html). Feel free to make pull request if you find errors or if you want to add new clients.
The raw yaml data is [here](https://github.com/ArtiskOnGit/subsonic_clients/blob/main/_data/clients.yml).
I was inspired by [this repo](https://github.com/basings/selfhosted-music-overview), but wanted to make a clearer version and only for subsonic clients.

### To potentially do :
  - being able to toggle on or off the raws of the tables.
  - detailed post for each client
  - add more clients
